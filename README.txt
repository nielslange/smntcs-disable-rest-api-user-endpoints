Disable the REST API user endpoints due to obscure user slugs.

== Description ==

With WordPress 4.7 the REST API is part of the core. At the moment everyone has read access to the REST API. As a result of that a potential intruder can retrieve a list of all user slugs via /wp-json/wp/v2/users. This plugin disables the REST API user endpoints to obscure the user slugs.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `smntcs-disable-rest-api-user-endpoints` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the `Plugins` menu in WordPress

== Screenshots ==

Simple activate the plugin and you're done.
